	<p>I <3 My Dog's design will consist of a combination of wearable sensors and a central station, as well as the
use of an external data server for calculations, data processing, and data storage, and the use of a web
application for consumption of the data. The wearables on the dog will include sensors for heart rate using
EKG, physical activity using a pedometer, and external body temperature using a thermometer. The
central station will have sensors for respiratory rate, blood pressure, and internal body temperature. Data
collected from the wearables will be sent to the central hub via Bluetooth. The data from the central hub
will be, both what is received from the wearables and what is collected at the station itself, will be sent to
the server via Wi-Fi. Beetle BLE microprocessor is what we intend to use for the wearable portions of the
system, because it can communicate with other microprocessors via Bluetooth. The central hub will be
powered by the Raspberry Pi 3, as it is able to communicate over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is what we
need for the central unit of our system. Certain sensors will use specialized chips for data collection, such
as the AD8232 Heart Rate Monitor to record EKG data.</p>
